# Inquiry-Based Learning SIGMAA
A Special Interest Group of the Mathematical Association of America


## Mission

Inquiry-based learning (IBL) in Mathematics is a pedagogical framework
in which students develop deep mathematical insights through collaborative,
communicative, and comprehension-building activities. The purpose of IBL SIGMAA
is to bring practitioners and others interested in IBL together to share
teaching resources and experiences, encourage and publicize research related to
IBL, and to promote the proliferation of IBL in Mathematics through
conversation and professional development.  Teachers and researchers come to
the IBL community for diverse reasons, and this SIGMAA is committed to a broad
and inclusive definition of IBL in terms of both classroom implementation and
the populations it can serve, including those populations historically
underserved by our discipline.

## What We Are Doing Now?

We are:

  * Organizing events at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and MathFest;
  * Coordinating with other groups interested in teaching with inquiry to advance our mission; and,
  * Working on outreach to underrepresented groups in the mathematics community.
