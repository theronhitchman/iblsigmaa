## Materials



<a href="http://jiblm.org/index.php" target="_new">Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics</a>
: JIBLM is a good source for IBL course notes for college courses. You can find
complete scripts of questions for a variety of topics, with helpful instructor's guides. [Trade Secret: the instructor's guides distill wisdom from many years of teaching! There is a lot to learn about IBL teaching hiding in these notes.]


<a href="https://www.artofmathematics.org" target="_new">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</a>
: This is an NSF-funded project to develop variants of <i>Mathematics for the
Liberal Arts</i> courses in an IBL style. There are 11 different versions of
those courses available here (for free!), and lots of information and help for
new users of IBL techniques.

## Mentoring and Workshops

The <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/" target="_new">Academy of Inquiry Based
Learning</a> is an organization for connecting IBL practitioners. AIBL runs
workshops every summer, and can match you with a mentor.
