  <h1 class="page-title">About IBL SIGMAA</h1>
  <h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The IBL SIGMAA was officially proposed to the MAA in August of 2015,
and officially sanctioned in spring of 2016. We were proud to submit
our application with a list of over 200 charter members.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-join">How to Join</h2>

<p>To join IBL SIGMAA, you can simply indicate this preference when renewing
your MAA membership. If you have a lifetime membership, or if you donâ€™t want
to wait Term complete in  your next renewal, call the MAA membership services
office and ask to join us.
<a href="http://www.maa.org/community/sigmaas/joining-a-sigmaa" target="_new">The MAA has more specifics on their site here.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h2>

<p>We welcome everyone to participate in our work. Submit a talk to one of our
parallel sessions at a meeting, or come by and participate in a panel
discussion.</p>

<p>If you have ideas to share about how the IBL SIGMAA could advance its mission,
or if you want to get more involved by joining the executive board,
<a href="/contact/">get in
touch with us</a>. The Executive Board is filled by elections each October, and
we welcome nominations and volunteers!</p>

<h2 id="the-current-executive-board">The Current Executive Board</h2>

<p>The executive board consists of five elected positions. The Chair-Elect, Chair,
and Past-Chair each serve for one year, but in a cycle progressing through all
three positions. Thus, being elected Chair-Elect is a three year commitment. An
election for Chair-Elect is held every year.</p>

<p>The Secretary/Treasurer and Program Coordinator are two-year positions, with
elections in alternate years. An election for Secretary/Treasurer is held in odd
numbered years, and the election for Program Officer is held in even numbered years.</p>

<p>The chair has the power to appoint other people to the executive board to fill
our needs. The Charter calls for the appointment of a Communications Officer,
and we currently also have Coordinator for Outreach and Advocacy.</p>

<p>In all cases, terms begin and end at the close of January, after the annual
Joint Mathematics Meetings.</p>
