## Focus Announcement on IBL SIGMAA

### Theron J Hitchman, University of Northern Iowa


In the last decade there has been a dramatic growth of interest among MAA members in using
inquiry-based learning (IBL) methods for teaching. If you scan the programs for the
last few national meetings of the MAA, you will see a large community of people and a lot
of activity organized around the ideas of IBL --- getting students to make sense of
the mathematics they study, to make and critique arguments about mathematics, and
to ask and answer questions with uncertain outcomes.

To support this community, a few of us have formed a new SIGMAA, the IBL SIGMAA. This has
just been approved by the MAA governance, and activities will begin this summer.
Having an officially sanctioned SIGMAA makes some things easier, like getting sessions
at the national meetings approved, and of course the MAA will help us maintain
a web presence, a mailing list, and a small budget for activities. But we feel
it is more important that the SIGMAA be a vehicle for the IBL community to
reach some mathematicians that we have not, yet, especially those from groups of
people who are underrepresented in the mathematics community.

A SIGMAA is a convenience for MAA members to organize some things they want
to do, and we hope that the members will take that as a challenge. The IBL SIGMAA
will do the kinds of things that its members find important, with a focus on
supporting anyone, of any level of experience, interested in using IBL in their
work.

Those who signed up to be charter members of IBL SIGMAA during our initial organization
phase have received an invitation to call the MAA offices and officially enroll.
Others who are interested will be able to sign up as part of their next membership renewal.
We hope you will join us as we work to better ourselves as educators and help each other
though the process.
